# How We Use Git and GitHub

## Code Reviews

- **Code reviews are not mandatory**
- Repos should not have their main branch set to require code reviews unless there is a very specific reason

Code reviews and feedback in general are a gift. When you get feedback, welcome it. Learn from it. When you give feedback, be kind. You should request code reviews on pull requests when you want or feel like you need feedback. This could be because you're trying something new and want another opinion. Or when you're working on a particularly important piece of a codebase.

Again, code reviews are not mandatory. You should feel comfortable merging code when you're confident in your changes.
