### Slack etiquette
- **Use public channels**: Not direct messages for most all communication. If you're asking a question or discussing work topics, there's a good chance that other team members have or will have the same question and/or benefit from the conversation in the future.
- **Don't spam**: Workspace and channel wide notifications should used rarely. Examples; `@here`, `@channel`. Reasons for using those
  - Important company-wide information like; we now sell ice cream
  - Technology emergencies; The API is down, the site is down, etc. These should be channel specific. #general doesn't need an `@here` to know the API is down.
- **Use threads**: If you're having a conversation that needs to go into detail, move it to a thread. This frees up the main channel and makes it easier to reference decisions later
- **Respect team members' time**: Some team members will enable do-not-disturb hours, but others won't, **avoid `@` messaging or DMing in off hours unless there is an emergency** Check to see if they're online by looking for the green circle next to their avatar
  - If you need to mention someone by name, but don't need to send them a notification use alternate spelling of their name like; "Sa(m)" or "Phill1p". Many team members set their first name as a highlight word
- **Don't go overboard on channels**: Don't create a new channel for every project or topic area. When there are too many channels, it's difficult for team members to know where to ask questions and share information. Example; Do *#website*: For ongoing discussion about the website. Don't *#website-homepage-redesign-q2-2021*
