## Slack

- Admins; Marc and Tyler
- Everyone with an ideas42ventures.com account can join
- Go to https://join.slack.com/t/ideas42ventures/signup Be sure you use your ideas42ventures.com email address
- Once you have access, say hello in the General channel (it will be quiet. As of this writing, there's only one member)

### Slack etiquette
- **Use public channels** not direct messages for most all communication. If you're asking a question or discussing work topics, there's a good chance that other team members have or will have the same question and/or benefit from the conversation in the future.
- Workspace and channel wide notifications should used rarely. Examples; `@here`, `@channel`. Reasons for using those
  - Important company-wide information like; we now sell ice cream
  - Technology emergencies; The API is down, the site is down, etc. These should be channel specific. #general doesn't need an `@here` to know the API is down.
- Use threads. If you're having a conversation that needs to go into detail, move it to a thread. This frees up the main channel and makes it easier to reference decisions later
- Respect team members' time. Some team members will enable do-not-disturb hours, but others won't, so avoid `@` messaging or DMing in off hours unless there is an emergency
  - If you need to mention someone by name, but don't need to send them a notification use alternate spelling of their name like; "Sa(m)" or "Phill1p". Many team members set their first name as a highlight word
