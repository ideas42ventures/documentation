# Onboarding

An outline for getting started working with the ideas42 Venture Studio team

## On the first day

Your focus for the first day is to get set up with various [internal tool](/internal-tools) accounts and to begin familiarizing yourself with our [efforts](/efforts) and processes.

### Accounts
1. An **ideas42ventures Google account**. This is for Gmail, Drive, Calendar, et al. A Google account admin will create an account for you and send and invite to your personal email address
2. **GitHub**. If you don't already have an account, you should create one. 
  - You can use an existing personal account for this
  - It does not need to be a new account with an ideas42ventures.com email address
  - Most of the team uses their personal GitHub account
  - An admin will invite you do the ideas42ventures GitHub Team which will give you full access to all repos in the team
  - For repos outside of the ideas42ventures Team like Nickels and Vergil, we will coordinate with those Admins to provide access when needed. This might not happen day 1
3. **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**. If you don't already have an account, you should create one
  - You can use an existing personal account for this
  - It does not need to be a new account with ideas42ventures.com email address
  - Most of our Figma docs are publicly accessible, if you have an account you can view and copy
  - We are still in the process of setting up a proper team, this will change in the future
 4. **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)** If you don't already have an account, you should create one
  - You can use an existing personal account for this. It's most helpful to authenticate with your GitHub account
  - It does not need to be a new account with ideas42ventures.com email address
 5. **Slack**. Everyone with an ideas42ventures.com account can join
   - Go do https://join.slack.com/t/ideas42ventures/signup Be sure you use your ideas42ventures.com email address
   - Once you have access, say hello in the General channel (it will be quiet. As of this writing, there's only one member)
 
### Process
Read through the [engineering](/engineering) documentation for a brief overview of how we work on projects. This isn't everything that we do. The documentation is an ongoing work in progress
 
### Projects
- Familiarize yourself with our ongoing [efforts](/efforts)
- Clone repos that you have access and begin looking at the code for each project
- For each repo, attempt to follow the local set up documentation in the README
- **If you run into errors or any trouble running a project locally**, if there is documentation in the README that you can update to resolve the issue, make those changes and submit a pull request.

## During your first week

- Get a detailed walk through by another team member of one or more projects. Walk through should cover
  - Current project status
  - Project history
  - Design approach and Figma doc
  - Code setup
  - TODOs, future ideas, etc.
- Go through the Git branch, pull request, merge process to make a contribution to at least one project
  - The contribution can be documentation or code that gets deployed to production
- Working with the team, plan work for the next week
